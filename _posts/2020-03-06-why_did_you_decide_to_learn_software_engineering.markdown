	 There are so many reasons why I decided to learn software engineering. I've always been fascinated by technology, and coding is a major marvel to me. Like so many others, I fell into the trap of living out other peoples patterns for life and settled into mediocrity. After everything fell apart in my life, I knew it was time to make the change to make my life what I want it to be. I've heard it all; your too old, coding is too hard, stick to what you know, and the list goes on. This has been a dream for myself for over a decade, and I'm so happy to meet this challenge head on. I'm not going to live another day living a quiet life of desperation. So I've mentally burned the ships because I won't retreat any more. This is all about renewal, destiny, and changing my stars.
	 Software Engineering is integrated into all fabrics of life and it's only growing. So deciding to learn this craft was for lack of a better term " a no brainer". You can program a machine to keep someone alive, you can make beautiful interactive art, it can regulate traffic, logistically provide help where its needed, and even as simple as getting coffee when you want it. You can't go anywhere (in a first world country) and not see someone on a smart phone, in a smart car, writing a blog in public, and/ or making money some way online. So rather than that resist the inevitable, why not learn it and contribute to the world while making a great living out of an awesome career.
	 So regardless of how or why, I know this is one of the best choices I could make for myself moving forward. Like most of us I'm a beginner, but I cant wait to learn, create, and grow on this journey. Embrace the struggle and you'll be forged stronger than imaginable.
